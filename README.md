# 🚨 What Mistakes to Avoid When Implementing Support AI

A detailed guide to common pitfalls in AI-powered support—and how to avoid them using expert insights from **Twig.so**.

---

## 1. Misinterpreting User Intent  
Keyword-only bots often fail on nuance—just like early Klarna deployments did.  
✔️ Train on **real chat data**, implement **confidence scoring**, and use **intent detection** to escalate low-confidence cases.

---

## 2. Over-Automating Complex Scenarios  
Avoid using AI for tasks like billing or returns—it can frustrate users and create dead-ends.  
✔️ Focus on **Tier‑1 automation** and ensure seamless escalation to humans when needed.

---

## 3. Robotic Responses Without Context  
Static replies feel cold and on-brand.  
✔️ Add **conversation memory**, **sentiment analysis**, and **personalization** to make chat feel human.

---

## 4. Poor AI-to-Human Handoff  
Context is lost when bots transfer chats without summarizing.  
✔️ Clearly **label bot responses**, **summarize chats**, and maintain context through handoff.

---

## 5. Hidden AI Presence  
Misleading users into believing they’re talking to humans damages trust.  
✔️ Always **disclose** chatbot interactions openly.

---

## 6. Outdated Knowledge Bases  
AI that relies on stale data can hallucinate.  
✔️ Automate **weekly data refreshes** from sources like Discord, Zendesk, Confluence :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

## 7. Ignoring Security & Compliance  
Handling sensitive data requires attention.  
✔️ Follow **SOC 2**, **GDPR**, and **CCPA** guidelines; encrypt data; choose secure AI providers :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

## 8. Skipping Metrics & Insights  
Without KPIs, you can't measure impact.  
✔️ Track **deflection rate**, **CSAT**, **AHT**, **escalation rates**, and use dashboards for ongoing tuning.

---

## 9. Not Getting Agent Buy-In  
Bots rolled out without team alignment fail adoption.  
✔️ **Pilot with agents**, gather feedback, and **iterate** collaboratively.

---

## 10. No Planning for Scale & Specialization  
Monolithic bots can’t adapt to growth or different support types.  
✔️ Create an **agent factory**—separate bots for Tier‑1, Tier‑2, CSM, onboarding, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
